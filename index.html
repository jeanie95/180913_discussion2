        My name is Jiin Suh and I am a student at University of Michigan, studying passionately in UI/UX design in both School of Art and Design and School of Information. I am also a minor in Art History. 
        I am from South Korea, but it has been almost ten years since I came to the US to find and pursue my dream. My dream that I found is to create a design that can change people's mind into changing the world into a better environment.</p>
    <p>I have worked as a graphic designer at Amore Pacific, a Korean cosmetics company, and Korean Institution of Technology and Science Information. I can comfortably use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd, and Final Cut Pro X. 
        With these programs, I have previously developed prototypes of mobile apps, designed brands and created posters and banners. 
    </p>
    <p>Fulfilling every moment is what I have learnt from spending 7 years in a foreign country alone. I am an international student studying in the United States ever since I was 15, which helped me to be independent and responsible. Living with 8 other girls who were in a similar situation, I learned to be cooperate and considerate. Having to be around people, I am great with getting along and working in groups. I take every task seriously and passionately, which helped me to impress my previous employers. I tend to surprise people by achieving more than what is expected of me as I take full responsibility on given tasks. 
        I strongly believe that my background and enthusiasm and the abilities I have developed will help me create something that will touch people's hearts.
